# Employee versus employer : Long story short
The value repartition between capital and work has been a long and hard debate in the society over the past 200 years, since the spread of the capitalsit era and the beginning of employment. Many attempted to define a fair model between workers as employees and owners as managers have been tried.
One part arguing that only the workers are providing the value, and that capital owners takes a pluevalue on the worrkfroce to make a profit. The other part argue that capital is essential to create a business activity and that the risk of ensuring that everybody will be paid even if the company model does not work, even at the end losing the whole capital invested needs to be rewared. This struggle has defiend a practice model that can be sumed up in three main categories : The corporate model, the Startup model, the cooperatve model. In this papaer, we will present a 4th model that mixes the best of three models.
A model where everybody is a shareholder of the company and everyboy is an employee, and all efforts are rewarded based on the time you have spent working actively in the company. We call it the Flowing Organization model. 

## Corporate, Startup or Cooperative?

We may simplify it here to improve readiness, but we can categorize 3 models of employee/employer relationships that excist mainly today

### The Corporare model

The corporare model is the simplde model where the shares are owned by shareholders, and managers operate the company assets and money by acquiring means of production and employing workers to do the job. Employees are most of the time not shareholders of the company and are paid at the same amount whatever the results of the company, even some corporations offer bonuses based on company overall performance, or for managers the possibility to buy stock options at reduced price to the conditition to stay a certai n mimimum of years in the company. Employees most of the time have no voting rights in the company decision. It his model, corporates often give dividends to shareholders, that is money created that does not go to employees even if they are in majority (almost in full) creating the value.

### The Startup model

The startup model is a more hybrid model, where founders and investors are in majority the shaeholders of the company, but there is in general a pool of shares for early employees. This pool of share is here to attract early employee and interest them to stay and grow the company. This pool iof shares can represent from 5 to 15% of the company, depending on how founders and investors decide how important are key employee in the company success.
What happens is that founders and early employees can have a huge stock difference, even if the early employee have been hired few months after the company. Also, late employees often have reisdual stock or even nothing. 
Contrary to the corporate model, for a long period of time, startup don't give dividends to shareholders and the money is reinvested into growth, then intro griwing the shares value.
On the voring right side, Employees most of the time have no voting rights in the company decision.

### The Cooperative model

The cooperative model is a model that is gaining popularity, where all employees are shareholders of the company, with equal voting rights between all employees, comnparable revenue models based on salary, and the equity is shared amongst all employees equitably.
