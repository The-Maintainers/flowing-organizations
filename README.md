# Flowing-organizations

Tl;dr : How ro reconcile startups models know to be efficient but not fair and opaque between founders and employees and cooperative models that have demontrated fair value shared but efficiency issue in their capacity to scale?
Here are flowing organizations, a new employee/founder model based on planned equity inflation over time, that allies transparency, attractivity and keeps efficicency in the ability to scale and govern the company.

# Employee versus employer : Long story short
The value repartition between capital and work has been a long and hard debate in the society over the past 200 years, since the spread of the capitalsit era and the beginning of employment. Many attempted to define a fair model between workers as employees and owners as managers have been tried.
One part arguing that only the workers are providing the value, and that capital owners takes a pluevalue on the worrkfroce to make a profit. The other part argue that capital is essential to create a business activity and that the risk of ensuring that everybody will be paid even if the company model does not work, even at the end losing the whole capital invested needs to be rewared. This struggle has defiend a practice model that can be sumed up in three main categories : The corporate model, the Startup model, the cooperatve model. In this papaer, we will present a 4th model that mixes the best of three models.
A model where everybody is a shareholder of the company and everyboy is an employee, and all efforts are rewarded based on the time you have spent working actively in the company. We call it the Flowing Organization model. 

## Corporate, Startup or Cooperative?

We may simplify it here to improve readiness, but we can categorize 3 models of employee/employer relationships that excist mainly today

### The Corporare model

The corporare model is the simplde model where the shares are owned by shareholders, and managers operate the company assets and money by acquiring means of production and employing workers to do the job. Employees are most of the time not shareholders of the company and are paid at the same amount whatever the results of the company, even some corporations offer bonuses based on company overall performance, or for managers the possibility to buy stock options at reduced price to the conditition to stay a certai n mimimum of years in the company. Employees most of the time have no voting rights in the company decision. It his model, corporates often give dividends to shareholders, that is money created that does not go to employees even if they are in majority (almost in full) creating the value.

### The Startup model

The startup model is a more hybrid model, where founders and investors are in majority the shaeholders of the company, but there is in general a pool of shares for early employees. This pool of share is here to attract early employee and interest them to stay and grow the company. This pool of shares can represent from 5 to 15% of the company, depending on how founders and investors decide how important are key employee in the company success.
What happens is that founders and early employees can have a huge stock difference, even if the early employee have been hired few months after the company. A founder can have 30% of the company where its first employee mays have 0.5% vested over 4 years and contributing at the end almost as much as the founder over a long period of time. Also in this model, late employees often have residual stock or even nothing. 
Contrary to the corporate model, for a long period of time, startup don't give dividends to shareholders and the money is reinvested into growth, then intro griwing the shares value.
On the voring right side, Employees most of the time have no voting rights in the company decision.

### The Cooperative model

The cooperative model is a model that is gaining popularity, where all employees are shareholders of the company, with equal voting rights between all employees, comnparable revenue models based on salary, and the equity is shared amongst all employees equitably. With an egalitarist model about value repartition and decision, we may have seen some issues about capacity of Cooperatives to scale their team, due to the fact that the last employee has the same reught than the early and

## A new relationship between workers and employers : the end of employment, the beginning of work

In an era of technology and skilled workers who are diving into entrepreneurship, we arrive in a time where this is not the the skilled worker to say what he/she can bring to the company, but to the company to tell the future employee what it can bring to him/her.
On the other side, we have more and more less skilled people who are unemployed but who want to be hired by corporations but that companies don't want to hire as they don't have the skillset required. So companies are in need to invest on their worker as it becomes the main asset of the business. And a new model of value repartition between employees and employers is needed can be beneficial for both sides of the hiring line.


## From the win-win to value based negociation model : how fair it is?

In the past, most of the negociation thoery was based on getting a win-win agreement. As long as everybody wins in a deal, the deal is good. But the problem is that the deal can be win-win but still not fair. In a deal, if one part earns $1 and the other earns $1,000,000 they are both in a winning situation, but they are not making a fair deal. If both parts knew what was earning the other one, the deal would not have probably happened, as the $1 winner would have asked a _fairer share_ of the valie created. 
In comapnies, either corporations or startups, the value created and the share than the employee gets is not transparent. Employees don't know exactly how much value they create to the company, and what they will earn is not depending on this value creation over time. It is based on the market value of your profile and your skills, and to the negociation power the company has with you, and all your competitors for the same job. 

In startups, the equity early employees gets is a little more transparent, but still quite opaque about the number of shares every employee gets at a certain time and a certain position, the company valuation at this time etc...
Lots of tech entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and elsewhere  argue that the startup model is fait because of its win-win aspect. the claim that if the company is successful and is worth billions, early employee even if they have a 50 to 100 times less shares to the founders will still be millionaires. And because of that, that is a fait deal, at least better than working for a big corporation that will never make you rich in millions like that. But we have seen that is based on win-win more that value based negocation, and even if employees accept the deal, this notthe fairest in an economical point of view. However, the execution model of startup and their ability to attract the best talent with this model make them the most efficient model for value creation.

In cooperatives, the model is egalitarian and transparent by design as everybody has the same share of the company. Econmically this is the fairest model, but it may lack of incentives for the early workers to continue to share the value over time with new entrants as the late arrivants have the same share and value that the ones doing the work for the last X years. The human aspect of social interaction and equity as time and energy spent to create the entity is denied. Fir that reason many cooperatives have developped mechanismes to rewards early employees with extra revenues.

The perfect model is in between. The efficiceny and the ability to scale from startups, the extra reward for early investements from startups and a fairer model between all workers from the cooperative.

### Principle : Flowing Organizations

The principle is the following :  every year, the company create shares that are splitted amongst the all the people working in the organization at that time in a equal part.
